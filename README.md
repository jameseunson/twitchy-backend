# twitchy-backend
Twitchy backend that enables OAuth authentication with Twitch.tv

Inspired by method described in http://stephenradford.me/oauth-login-on-tvos/

This app is deployed at http://twitchy.jeon.com.au/code and is a companion to https://github.com/jameseunson/twitchy that enables users to login to their Twitch.tv account via OAuth. Because tvOS cannot display a webview, a third-party website is required to enable OAuth logins.

More information about the Twitchy project is available here: http://jeon.com.au/twitchy
